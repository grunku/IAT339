# IAT339

This is a git repository for our IAT339 Project 2. It is a website for StickShift, a shipping company dedicated to easing 
the distribution of arcade machines throughout different regions worldwide. The design of the website is meant to evoke 
the feelings of interfacing with the sort of products they sell
